# Ideas for data analysis

Analyzing game results and visualizing the control over territories in Risk can provide valuable insights into player strategies and game dynamics. Here are some ideas for illustrating map control over time, along with the stacked line chart you mentioned:

1. **Stacked Line Charts or Area Charts**:
Use Case: Show the change in the number of territories each player controls over time.
Visualization: Stacked line charts or area charts help visualize how the territory control shifts between players as the game progresses.
Implementation: Plot the cumulative number of territories controlled by each player at each turn. The stacked chart will show how control shifts between players.

2. **Heatmap of Territory Control**:
Use Case: Show which territories each player controls at each turn.
Visualization: Create a heatmap where the x-axis represents the turn number and the y-axis represents the territory name. The cells are colored based on which player controls the territory at that turn.
Implementation: Assign each player a unique color and fill in the heatmap accordingly.

3. **Animated Map**:
Use Case: Animate how the map evolves turn by turn.
Visualization: Create an animation where each frame represents a turn, and the map is updated to show which player controls each territory.
Implementation: Use a geographical map layout of the territories and change the color of each territory based on the player who controls it at each turn. You can use libraries like matplotlib or plotly for this.

4. **Bar Chart Race**:
Use Case: Visualize the growth of player territory control over time.
Visualization: Create a bar chart race where each bar represents a player, and the length of the bar indicates the number of territories controlled. The race progresses as the turns advance.
Implementation: Use libraries like plotly or matplotlib to create the bar chart race animation.

5. **Line Charts for Troop Strength**:
Use Case: Track the number of troops each player has over time.
Visualization: Plot a line chart where the x-axis is the turn number, and the y-axis is the total number of troops each player controls.
Implementation: For each turn, sum the number of troops for each player across all territories and plot this over time.

6. **Player Eliminations Timeline**:
Use Case: Show when players are eliminated from the game.
Visualization: Use a Gantt chart or timeline chart to show when each player is eliminated.
Implementation: Each player gets a horizontal bar, and the length of the bar represents how many turns they lasted in the game.

7. **Correlation Matrix**:
Use Case: Show how different factors correlate over time, such as troop strength and territory control.
Visualization: Create a correlation matrix where the x and y axes represent different factors, such as territory count, troop strength, etc. The matrix shows how these factors correlate for each player.
Implementation: Use a correlation matrix heatmap to show the strength and direction of the relationships between factors.

8. **Victory Probability Tracking**:
Use Case: Estimate the probability of victory for each player as the game progresses.
Visualization: Use a line chart to track how the probability of each player winning changes over time.
Implementation: Based on game state metrics (territory count, troop strength, etc.), estimate each player's likelihood of winning and track this over time.
